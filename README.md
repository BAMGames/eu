Install

After downloading the client, just unzip it and click on the jar file if your system can execute jar.
If not, click on the bat or sh file.

Do not forget to update your configuration file (eu.properties) for your login.

If you want to do a soft install, you can download only the jar instead of the zip and replace your jar with the new one.
Be careful to do only a soft install if you are sure no external file (images, translations,...) was changed.
